# The NEXUS Knowledge Base

Welcome to the core intellectual repository of the YX NEXUS project. This knowledge base is not merely a collection of technical documents; it is the codified representation of our design philosophy, architectural principles, and the strategic decisions that shape our digital ecosystem.

This section is designed to answer the fundamental "Why?" behind our work. Before diving into code or developer guides, understanding the concepts within this base is crucial for any contributor seeking to align with the project's vision.

## Table of Contents

1.  **[01 Vision & Philosophy](./01_VISION_AND_PHILOSOPHY.md)**
    *   The foundational constitution of our project. It outlines the core aesthetic and ethical principles that guide every decision, from the choice of a color palette to the architecture of our systems. This is the North Star of our journey.

2.  **[02 NEXUS Architecture](./02_NEXUS_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
    *   A deep dive into the event-driven, service-oriented architecture of the NEXUS backend. This document explains the "symphony" of our digital organism's internal workings.

3.  **[03 AURA Architecture](./03_AURA_ARCHITECTURE.md)**
    *   An exploration of the "single source of truth," unidirectional data flow architecture of the AURA frontend. This document details how we translate the backend's inner state into a living, breathing user interface.

4.  **[04 Core Concepts](./04_CORE_CONCEPTS.md)**
    *   A glossary of the essential nouns and verbs of our ecosystem. It defines key terms like `Message`, `Run`, `Session`, and `Agentic Loop`, providing a shared language for all contributors.

## Technical Deep Dives

5.  **[Frontend Technical References](./frontend_references/)**
    *   Design-driven technical documentation for the AURA frontend. Each document bridges design philosophy with technical implementation, reflecting the unique nature of frontend engineering where user experience and code quality are inseparable.

6.  **[Backend Technical References](./technical_references/)**
    *   Implementation-level documentation for NEXUS backend subsystems. Covers environment configuration, command system, identity architecture, and dynamic personalization—the invisible engine that powers the experience.
